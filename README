This is a unfinished project for the Nintendo Switch. I've wrote this a few years ago, and I've lost the source code by mistake. What's left is the recovered source code from an very, very earlier version, and the latest compiled executable that was inside the SD-CARD of the Nintedo Switch.

The actual source cost is not compilable. I removed an asset that was in the romfs folder because it is not used in the bundled executable, and were copyrighted I guess.

I borrowed the sound from [Beldoroon](https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=35655) at modarchive.  
The font used is [ProggyClean](https://www.dafont.com/proggy-clean.font)  
Sprites cames from the XR group (in the final version).

To run that on your Nintendo Switch, download [rebellion_half_release.tar.gz](./rebellion_half_release.tar.gz), extract it, and put **rebellion.nro** in the switch folder of your SD-CARD. Run it with Homebrew Launcher **not in applet mode** (start a game with L trigger, not the Album). 

Features blip and blop, fake rasters, a starfield, a one liner, a bouncing text, a bouncing logos, some hilbert curves, a rotozoom, and a few particles at the "end".

Exit by pressing "+". The last screen is static and the music will loop forever.

I am not affiliated with XR. I like shiny colors and boucing pixels, mathematics, painting, and freedom.
